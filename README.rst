FeatureGridCreator plugin
=========================

This is a QGIS plugin (http://qgis.org) to generate a grid of features: points (boreholes) or polygons (trenches).

It is also possible to add 'id's to those by hovering over them.

Read more about it in the docs: https://rduivenvoorde.github.io/featuregridcreator/FeatureGridCreator/help/html/en/
